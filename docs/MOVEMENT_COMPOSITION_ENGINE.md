# MOVEMENT COMPOSITION ENGINE

**"Compose your training like music. Perform your body like art."**

---

## THE CORE FRAME

Training = Music  
Sets = Bars  
Reps = Beats

| Training Element | Music Element |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Timeline | Track length |
| Music track | Emotional arc |
| Exercises | Instruments |
| Sets | Musical bars |
| Reps | Beats |
| Tempo | BPM |
| Rest | Silence / breath |
| Skill holds | Sustained notes |

**A session becomes: A composition of tension, release, rhythm, and stillness.**

## MOVEMENT ORCHESTRATION SYSTEM

### Layer 1 – Rhythm (Music)

BPM defines:
- Rep speed
- Isometric hold duration
- Transition tempo

| BPM Range | Training Mode |
|-----------|--------------|
| 60-80 | Slow strength / control |
| 80-120 | Standard tempo work |
| 120-160 | Flow, conditioning |
| 160+ | Explosive / power |

### Layer 2 – Movement Families (Instruments)

| Movement Family | Instrument Role | Examples |
|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Push | Percussion | Push-up, Dip, HSPU |
| Pull | Bass | Pull-up, Row, Muscle-up |
| Legs | Rhythm Guitar | Squat, Lunge, Pistol |
| Core | Harmony | Hollow, L-sit, Pike |
| Skills | Lead Melody | Planche, Front Lever, Manna |

**"No song is just drums. No training is just push-ups."**

### Layer 3 – Emotional Programming

| Music Track | Emotional State | Training Mode |
|-------------|----------------|---------------|
| Faith Over Fear | Resolve | Slow strength, holds |
| Tears of Joy | Release | Flow, tempo sets |
| Lost in Paradise | Dissociation | Long skill attempts |
| For You | Presence | Control + breath-led reps |

**This is emotionally intelligent programming. Not just reps — ritual.**
