## THE FADER CONCEPT (Workout Blocks)

A block = 2-3 exercises with TWO controls:

**FADER 1: FLEXIBILITY ↔ STRENGTH**
```
[FLEXIBILITY]                              [STRENGTH]
Passive middle split     →    Active middle split    →    Active middle split
Passive butterfly        →    Passive butterfly      →    Active tailor + weight
```

**FADER 2 (KNOB): VOLUME**
- Low: 2 exercises
- Medium: 3 exercises  
- High: 4 exercises

## THE 7-LAYER ARCHITECTURE

### Layer 1: MICRO UNITS (Non-expressive alone)
| Language | Music | Movement |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Morpheme, token, word | Microtiming, single hit, pizzicato | Muscle fiber activation, joint angle change, micro adjustments (wrist turn, scapula set, breath) |

### Layer 2: EXPRESSIVE UNITS (Style begins)
| Language | Music | Movement |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Collocation, phrase, chunk, clause, sentence | Interval, riff, lick, bar, short melodic phrase | Single rep, rep + breath, basic combo, clean execution, short flow (2-3 linked) |

### Layer 3: SEQUENCE (Coherent motion)
| Language | Music | Movement |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Utterance, turn, exchange, paragraph | Call/response, Q&A motive, 2-4 bar phrase, verse fragment | Short set (5-8 reps), mini flow, environment exchange (bar/floor/wall), micro-sequence |

### Layer 4: STRUCTURE (Narrative emerges)
| Language | Music | Movement |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Passage, scene, vignette, chapter | Verse, chorus, bridge, full song, suite | Full routine, workout block, movement theme (pulling day), training cycle |

### Layer 5: SYSTEM (Philosophy codified)
| Language | Music | Movement |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Outline, template, playbook, protocol | Composition style, genre conventions, production workflows | Training methodology, programming templates, progression protocols, coaching systems |

### Layer 6: PRODUCT & PLATFORM (Living containers)
| Language | Music | Movement |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Product, platform, repository, knowledge base | Album, artist brand, label, catalog | Program, app, methodology, Saturno Movement OS |

### Layer 7: CANON & LEGACY
| Language | Music | Movement |
|----------|-------|----------|
| Canon, universe, legacy, archive | Artist body of work, genre-defining sound | Movement system that outlives you, school of calisthenics, canon in movement culture |

## THE UNIVERSAL SCALING LAW

All creative domains follow the same progression:
1. **Micro-position** → atomic units
2. **Expressive phrases** → style emerges
3. **Narrative sequence** → dialogue with environment
4. **Structure composition** → tension & resolution
5. **Codified systems** → philosophy becomes method
6. **Living ecosystems** → people enter your world
7. **Cultural legacy** → you outlive yourself

## THE MUSIC → MOVEMENT MAPPING

```
Sound Effect    →    Joint Movement (knee flexion, hip extension)
Loop            →    Movement (push-up, squat)
8-16 Bars       →    Workout (session)
Song            →    Microcycle (1 week)
Album           →    Mesocycle (4-6 weeks)
```

## THE PRODUCT VISION

**Not just workouts:**
- Movements on the left
- Writing hub on the right
- Timeline in the center
- Habits, reminders, tasks layered on top
- Videos play as timeline plays
- Panels are draggable/resizable

**The tagline evolves:**
- Design Your Workout
- Design Your Day
- Design Your Routine
- Design Your Life

## WHY THIS MATTERS

"All three domains share the same scaling law... That's why my instincts always take things to matrices, codexes, taxonomies, Movement DNA."

This is not an app. This is:
- A unified theory of human expression
- A framework that spans language, music, and movement
- The operating system for creative mastery
- A legacy system that outlives its creator
